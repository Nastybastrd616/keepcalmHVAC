Here’s a refined prompt you can use with Copilot (or ChatGPT) to help you build a full-featured HVAC business website using Vue 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, with all the features you described:

Prompt for Copilot/ChatGPT:

Build a modern HVAC business website using Vue 3 and Vite. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. The site should include the following pages and features:

Pages:

Home: Add a hero section, a slideshow component (auto-cycles images every 3–5 seconds from a local folder or external URL), and quick service highlights.
Services: List services using a reusable PriceCard.vue component, grouped by category, with pricing and icons.
About: Include company history, staff bios, and license info.
Contact: Add a contact form, Google Maps embed, and business hours.
Login: Implement authentication using Firebase Auth or Flask/JWT.
Dashboard (Customer): Show equipment, maintenance plan, warranty info, and allow service requests based on available calendar slots.
Admin: Role-based access. Admins can upload photos for the slideshow/gallery, manage users, view/edit maintenance records, and configure persistent calendar availability.
Components:

SlideshowGallery.vue: Reusable slideshow that auto-cycles images.
PriceCard.vue: For displaying service details.
Calendar.vue: Integrate FullCalendar, allow admin to block/unblock dates, and customers to view/request appointments.
Backend:

Build a Flask API to serve user info, service requests, warranty info, and calendar slots.
Use MongoDB or Firebase for data persistence.
Bonus:

Use Pinia or Vuex for state management.
Protect routes using navigation guards.
