# Square API Integration - Admin Panel Project Plan

## Overview

Build a secure admin panel inside a Vite + Vue.js project to manage your Square Catalog (Price Book). The panel will support viewing, adding, editing, and deleting items using the Square API.

---

## Frontend (Vue.js)

### Stack

* Vite + Vue 3
* Vue Router
* Pinia (for state management)
* Axios (for API requests)

### Pages/Components

* **Login.vue** – Simple password-protected access (can be hardcoded for MVP)
* **Dashboard.vue** – Main panel layout
* **CatalogList.vue** – List all catalog items
* **CatalogItem.vue** – Component to show/edit single item
* **AddItemForm.vue** – Form to add new item

### Features

* Password login gate
* Fetch and display catalog items
* Item detail view/edit modal
* Add new item form
* Delete item confirmation

### Copilot Prompt

```js
// Vue 3 + Pinia + Axios
// Component to fetch and display list of Square Catalog items from backend
```

---

## Backend (Node.js with Express)

### Stack

* Node.js
* Express.js
* dotenv
* CORS
* Square SDK

### Endpoints

* `GET /api/catalog` – List catalog items
* `GET /api/catalog/:id` – Get single item
* `POST /api/catalog` – Create new item
* `PUT /api/catalog/:id` – Update item
* `DELETE /api/catalog/:id` – Delete item

### Middleware

* Basic auth or token middleware for added security (optional)

### Copilot Prompt

```js
// Express.js route to list Square Catalog items using Square SDK
```

---

## Square Integration

### Requirements

* Square access token from Developer Dashboard
* Use Catalog API endpoints: `/v2/catalog/list`, `/v2/catalog/object`, etc.

### Notes

* Use "ITEM" and "ITEM\_VARIATION" object types
* Handle pagination with `cursor`

### Copilot Prompt

```js
// Function using Square SDK to fetch and return catalog items
```

---

## Environment Setup

### .env file

```
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
PORT=3000
```

### Folder Structure

```
project-root/
├─ frontend/ (Vite + Vue)
├─ backend/ (Node + Express)
│  ├─ routes/
│  └─ services/square.js
└─ .env
```

---

## Deployment Notes

* Host frontend and backend separately or with a proxy setup
* Ensure secure storage of Square token
* Implement rate limiting if open to web

---

Let me know if you'd like code scaffolding or boilerplate to get started.

## Project: Square API GUI + Chatbot Integration

### PHASE 1 – BACKEND ROUTES (Flask)

| Resource   | Endpoint                  | Method | Description             |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| Customers  | /api/customers            | GET    | List customers          |
|            | /api/customers            | POST   | Create customer         |
|            | /api/customers/<id>       | GET    | Get customer by ID      |
|            | /api/customers/<id>       | PUT    | Update customer         |
|            | /api/customers/<id>       | DELETE | Delete customer         |
| Invoices   | /api/invoices             | GET    | List invoices           |

|            | /api/invoices/<id>        | PUT    | Update invoice          |
|            | /api/invoices/<id>        | DELETE | Delete invoice          |
| Estimates  | /api/estimates            | GET    | List estimates          |
|            | /api/estimates            | POST   | Create estimate         |
|            | /api/estimates/<id>       | PUT    | Update estimate         |
|            | /api/estimates/<id>       | DELETE | Delete estimate         |
| Scheduling | /api/schedule             | GET    | List appointments       |
|            | /api/schedule             | POST   | Add appointment         |
|            | /api/schedule/<id>        | PUT    | Edit appointment        |
|            | /api/schedule/<id>        | DELETE | Delete appointment      |
| Chatbot    | /api/chat-intent (future) | POST   | Accept chatbot commands |

---

### Chatbot Integration Prep

* API endpoints will be called with JSON intents like:

```json
{
  "action": "create_invoice",
  "customer": "John Smith",
  "amount": 350,
  "due_date": "2025-06-01",
  "description": "AC service and coil cleaning"
}
```

* Same backend routes will serve GUI + chatbot

---

### Next Step Options

* Scaffold full frontend/backend folder
* Build each page & route one by one
* Start with customers or invoices first?
